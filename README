NAME
    RDF::KML::Exporter - export RDF geo data to KML (Google Earth)

SYNOPSIS
     use RDF::KML::Exporter;
 
     my $exporter = RDF::KML::Exporter->new;
     my $input    = 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lewes';
 
     print $exporter->export_kml($input)->render;

DESCRIPTION
  Constructor
    *   "new(%options)"

        Returns a new RDF::KML::Exporter object.

        There are no valid options at the moment - the hash is reserved for
        future use.

  Methods
    *   "export_kml($input, %options)"

        Returns a KML document including all the locations in the input, in
        no particular order.

        The input may be a URI, file name, RDF::Trine::Model or anything
        else that can be handled by the "parse" function of
        RDF::TrineX::Functions.

        The returned object is an Geo::GoogleEarth::Pluggable instance,
        which can be output as XML using its "render" method.

  RDF Input
    Input is expected to use the W3C's WGS84 Geo Positioning vocabulary
    <http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#>. Place names should use
    rdfs:label.
